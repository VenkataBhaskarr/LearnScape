## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration -
Going through the CNCF landscape and getting started with contributions gets overwhelming. We wanted to simplify the existing landscape for beginners and added a roadmap too for folks who want to learn more in the field of DevOps. 

This platform is developed such that it can guide new folks and learn concepts such as Docker and Kubernetes even if they contribute to this project because of the tools used in this project such as Docker, Datree, Alan AI, Firebase and Twilio. 

This section is the backend api of the project. The fronted/client consumes this api in order to fetch the details of the several cncf projects and their information which can be needed by the beginner.

## ðŸ›¤ Routes Available -

### ðŸš© 1. `/api/v1/projects` 
Gets all the projects in the database. The typical response looks like

**Example 1**
An ideal request will look like
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects`

And ideal respons will look like
```json
{
    "status": "successs",
    "result": 13,
    "projects": [
        {
            "socials": {
                "website": "https://kyverno.io",
                "github": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno",
                "twitter": "https://twitter.com/kyverno"
            },
            "_id": "61b35a39074e61abf2b0f0d4",
            "name": "Kyverno",
            "tags": [
                "cncf-sandbox",
                "LF-project",
                "CII best practices 21%",
                "Open Source Software"
            ],
            "category": [
                "Provisioning",
                "Security and Compliance"
            ],
            "programmingLanguages": [
                "Go",
                "Shell"
            ],
            "programsInvolvement": [
                "lfx"
            ],
            "createdAt": "2021-12-10T13:46:32.929Z",
            "id": "61b35a39074e61abf2b0f0d4"
        },
        .
        .
        .
    ]
}

```

### ðŸš© 2. `/api/v1/projects/<project id>`
Gets specific project from large project data. The project id here is given by the database.

**Example 1**
An ideal request will look like
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects/61b35a39074e61abf2b0f0d4`

And ideal respons will look like
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "project": {
        "socials": {
            "website": "https://kyverno.io",
            "github": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno",
            "twitter": "https://twitter.com/kyverno"
        },
        "_id": "61b35a39074e61abf2b0f0d4",
        "name": "Kyverno",
        "tags": [
            "cncf-sandbox",
            "LF-project",
            "CII best practices 21%",

        ],
        "category": [
            "Provisioning",
            "Security and Compliance"
        ],

            "Go",
            "Shell"
        ],
        "programsInvolvement": [
            "lfx"
        ],
        "createdAt": "2021-12-10T13:46:32.929Z",
        "__v": 0,
        "id": "61b35a39074e61abf2b0f0d4"
    }
}
```

### ðŸš© 3. `/api/v1/projects?page=<page-no>&limit=<no-of projects>` 
This will give you no-of project provided in *limit* field and you can increment the page no to get the next *limit* frame data.

**Example 1**
An ideal request will look like (PAGE 1)
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects?page=1&limit=5`
And ideal respons will look like
```json
{
    "status": "successs",
    "result": 5,
    "projects": [
        {
            "socials": {
                "website": "https://thanos.io/",
                "github": "https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos",
                "twitter": "https://twitter.com/ThanosMetrics"
            },
            "_id": "61b35a39074e61abf2b0f0d7",
            "name": "Prometheus",

                "LF-project",
                "CII best practices passing",
                "Open Source Software"
            ],
            "category": [
                "Observability and Analysis",
                "Monitoring"
            ],
            "programmingLanguages": [
                "Go",
                "TypeScript",
                "Jsonnet"

        },
        .
        .
        .
    ]
}
```

**Example 2**
An ideal request will look like (PAGE 3)
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects?page=3&limit=5`
And ideal respons will look like (As there are only 13 projects and we are showing 5 per page)
```json
{
    "status": "successs",
    "result": 3,
    "projects": [
        {
            "socials": {

![forking the project](https://i.imgur.com/qbVouuV.png)

2. Once you are in your fork the url should look something like
`https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/LearnScape/`

3. Go to preferred folder in your computer and paste the following command (Only one of it if you don't have ssh setup then go with HTTP command)
   - HTTP
   `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/LearnScape.git`
   - SSH
   `git clone git@github.com:<YOUR-USERNAME>/LearnScape.git`

4. Now enter the folder by running the following command
`cd LearnScape/api`

5. Now you are in the `/api` folder
